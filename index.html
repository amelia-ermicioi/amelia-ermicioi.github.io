            <p class="lead">Hello, my name is <strong>Amelia Ermicioi</strong></p>
            <p>On the time when this page was created, I got 6 months old, so obvious that this page was not created by me!</p>
            <p>My father thought that some day I will become a programmer, Java programmer (that why in my interests is written Java).<br />
                So he decided to create a Github account for me, to reserve it for my future, poor father, he thinks I will become a programmer, 
                but let's not break his dream.<br />
                By the way, I may become opera singer, my mom's nightmare!<br />
                So let's wait for 20 years and we will see. <br /></p>
                
            <p>Oh yes, my father also create an email account for me, which is <a href="mailto:amelia.ermicioi@gmail.com">amelia.ermicioi@gmail.com</a>, 
            sure you can write me emails, but obvious for couple of years I will not be able to read them.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile if you have question please contact my parents:

            <p><em>P.S. Dear other Amelia Ermicioi, in case you are programmer and want to have same account on Github, 
                you will need to wait till I am grown and made the decision to be or not to be the programmer, so I am sorry :(</em></p>
